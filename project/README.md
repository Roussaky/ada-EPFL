# Graphical representation of the Panama Papers Leaks
__Abstract-__ The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorneyâ€“client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. As a general rule, it is often difficult to have a proper visualization of the data. But in our case, a graphical representation is possible and could help people to have a better understanding and therefore be aware of the hidden side of finance. Then we would like to correlate the fiscal context of each country (new taxes rules, economic regulations, etc.) with the funds flow described in these papers. 

# Research questions
- There is a pattern between the entities quoted in these papers and their origin country ?
- Can we forecast a tax change just by using a temporal data processing ?
- Under what parameters a client is more likely to trust an offshore entities? Does it change with the time ?

# Dataset
- __[Panama papers](https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database)__ : This dataset has been built by ICIJ, they have done a marvelous job by taking the leaked files to build this graph database. We can say that this is a "full" dataset and on top of that well documented.
- __[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)__ : We plan to query this database to enrich our graph model. Looking for informations like economic system, policatal stability for each country. We don't need all the data so the querry system (SPARQL) is advantageous for our specific research.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Do exploratory analysis 
- Understanding data
- Extract useful feature
- Find a library to allow us to draw an interactive graph

# Questions for TAa
- Are we allow to use other programmation language ?
- There is restriction in use of python librairies ?
- It is too ambitious (our project) ?
