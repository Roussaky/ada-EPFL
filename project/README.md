# Panama Papers.

# Abstract
## The project idea:
The main idea is to visualize the entities that are part of the Panama Papers. Understand where the funds comes from and see if any events are the results of a number of offshore entities than usual.

## Goals:
- See if there is a link between the fiscal context of the country (new taxes rules, subprime crysis, etc.)
- The Offshore leaks database might help finding a specific person or company behind the offshore company.
- Based on this we can set a network which allow us to explore connections and relationships between all features (company, related adresses, shareholders, â€¦) 
- Then we can filter people by country and see correlations.
## Dataset used:
- The panama papers dataset
