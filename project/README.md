# Graphical representation of the Panama Papers Leaks
__Abstract-__ The Panama Papers are 11.5 millions leaked documents that detail financial and attorneyâ€“client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. As a general rule, it is often difficult to have a proper visualization of the data. But in our case, a graphical representation is possible and could help people to have a better understanding and therefore be aware of the hidden side of finance. Then we would like to correlate the fiscal context of each country (new taxes rules, economic regulations, etc.) with the funds flow described in these papers. 

# Research questions
- Understand how the Panama became a fiscal paradise.
- Is there a pattern between the entities quoted in these papers and their origin country ?
- Can we forecast the political or economical situation of a country just by using these data and the number of offshores entity ?
