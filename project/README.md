# Helping a student to find his way into the computer sciences field by dressing the profil of StackOverflow user.

# Abstract
The project idea:
The main idea is to visualize the main technologies, see if it vary depending the country,dress the main portrait of the computer scientist, etc.

Goals:
We want to help young student to convince that they want to study Computer Science, or to determine where they wan't to work based on the technology used in different countries.
We want also to see where the website is used and why it is not used (Other website popular in the region, ...).

Dataset used:
To do this, we will use the stackOverflow survey 2017 found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data .

What story you would like to tell and why? 
Our story will be about the work of a computer scientist to have at the end a better understanding of this field, which quite new compared most the others.
Are people happy at work ? Does this happiness depends of the technology/country ?

What's the motivation behind your project?
KÃ©vin, Mehdi and I will start working at the end of the semester. Doing this perhaps help us to choose a country or a technology to start working with.
